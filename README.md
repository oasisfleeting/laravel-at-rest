## Laravel PHP Framework

Usage: Start by creating the database 

`CREATE DATABASE laravelatrest`

build your vendor repo using 

`composer install`

and 

`npm install package.json --save-dev`

then run the migraton

`/home/oasisfleeting/web/public_html/laravel-at-rest#> php artisan migrate:install`


as I didn't have time to fully integrate artisan commands into the user interface they have not been tested and are definitely
not fully functional, but there is one custom artisan command that can be used to fetch and parse the inital xml needed for this
application to run.

`fetch:listings`

eveything else can be done using the corresponding buttons or using the correct console commands.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
